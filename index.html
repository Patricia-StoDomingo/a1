				Patricia Sto. Domingo was born in a family of five in a small peaceful town where trees are more abundant than cars. She is an architect, a programmer, a writer, an avid gamer, a musician, but most importantly, a dreamer. She loves learning new stuff and reading all sorts of books, as well as discovering new things and creating stories out of them. She is quite a creative individual and some people might say that her head is always in the clouds, but she believes that she have planted her roots firmly on the ground and staring up at the sky to marvel its beauty is what inspires her to dream higher and reach higher grounds without plucking her roots.She someday dreams of being able to travel space and be an astronaut, build her own library and amass a huge collection of books,  and dive the depths of the deepest trench. Her greatest goal in life is to live a fulfilled, and content life, and leave the world a better place than before she was born.
